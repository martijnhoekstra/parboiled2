[parboiled2](http://parboiled2.org) is a macro-based PEG parser generator for Scala 2.10.3+,
enabling lightweight and easy-to-use, yet powerful, fast and elegant parsing of arbitrary input text.
It serves well as a replacement for Scala's parser combinators and regular expressions where parsing performance,
readability/maintainability of the parser definition and/or error reporting quality is of the essence.
